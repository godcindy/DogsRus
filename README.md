Dog Purchasing Site

On this site you will be able to navigate from page to page by clicking on the links provided - for example: Home, Logo, Family Member, etc.

The user will have the option of reading more in the explore me page to find out more information about the services offered from this site.
They will then see some images and see 'featured family member' along with breed and price.

Further down the page the user can link to receive information retrieved through an API call that will list dog facts.

When the user clicks on the following links (listed below) they will see the following:

Family Member: A list of dogs available for purchase along with price and the ability to add them to their cart. In addition, in this page they will be able to sort the dogs by breed, price in ascending and descending order.

About: This page will detail a little more about DogsRUs.

Contact: This will contain a link in order for the user to reach out to DogsRUs. The user can click on the email link and their email will automatically generate with a subject that will let DogsRUs know it is a contact through the website.

Account: This will allow the user to create an account to log in in the future or to log in if they are already a member.  This page also has a feature that allows the user to choose between Login and Register and depending on what they choose it will provide the user with the correct form.

Cart: Currently this is hardcoded for what the appearance of the page will be when a dog is added for purchase.

Media Screen is also available when the user is not on a desktop and all of the same capabilities are available.
